CONSTANTS
    Agents,          \* Set of quorum model slots (e.g., {"a1","a2","a3","a4","a5"})
    MaxDeliberation, \* Maximum deliberation rounds before forced DECIDED (default: 9)
    MaxSize          \* Cap on voters polled per round (default: 3)

ASSUME MaxDeliberation \in Nat /\ MaxDeliberation > 0

\* N = total number of agents; used for cardinality checks
N == Cardinality(Agents)

ASSUME MaxSize \in 1..N

\* AgentSymmetry: referenced by MCsafety.cfg as SYMMETRY AgentSymmetry.
AgentSymmetry == Permutations(Agents)

VARIABLES
    phase,              \* One of: "IDLE", "COLLECTING_VOTES", "DELIBERATING", "DECIDED"
    successCount,       \* Number of APPROVE votes collected in current round
    polledCount,        \* Number of agents actually recruited this round (≤ MaxSize; may be less if roster runs dry)
    deliberationRounds  \* Number of deliberation rounds completed

\* CollectVotes(n, p): n APPROVE votes from p polled agents (p ≤ MaxSize).
\* unanimityMet (successCount >= polledCount): All polled agents approved (unanimity within the polled set).
\* n = p → DECIDED; otherwise → DELIBERATING.

\* Deliberate(n): n APPROVE votes after a deliberation round.
\* Unanimity or exhaustion (deliberationRounds >= MaxDeliberation) → DECIDED.

\* ── Safety invariants ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

\* UnanimityMet: if DECIDED via approval, unanimity was achieved or deliberation was exhausted.
\* @requirement QUORUM-02
\* @requirement SAFE-01
UnanimityMet ==
    phase = "DECIDED" =>
        (successCount = polledCount \/ deliberationRounds >= MaxDeliberation)

\* QuorumCeilingMet: when DECIDED, polledCount did not exceed MaxSize.
\* @requirement QUORUM-03
\* @requirement SLOT-01
QuorumCeilingMet ==
    phase = "DECIDED" =>
        /\ polledCount <= MaxSize
        /\ (successCount = polledCount \/ deliberationRounds >= MaxDeliberation)

\* NoInvalidTransition: IDLE can only advance to COLLECTING_VOTES.
\* Kept for backwards compatibility; AllTransitionsValid covers this and all other states.
NoInvalidTransition ==
    [][phase = "IDLE" => phase' \in {"IDLE", "COLLECTING_VOTES"}]_vars

\* AllTransitionsValid: every state can only reach its defined successors.
\* Covers all four states — a superset of NoInvalidTransition.
\* @requirement SAFE-02
AllTransitionsValid ==
    /\ [][phase = "IDLE" => phase' \in {"IDLE", "COLLECTING_VOTES"}]_vars
    /\ [][phase = "COLLECTING_VOTES" => phase' \in {"COLLECTING_VOTES", "DELIBERATING", "DECIDED"}]_vars

    /\ [][phase = "DECIDED" => phase' = "DECIDED"]_vars

\* DeliberationBounded: deliberationRounds never exceeds MaxDeliberation.
\* Follows from the guard noInfiniteDeliberation on the DELIBERATING→DELIBERATING branch.
\* @requirement LOOP-01
DeliberationBounded ==
    deliberationRounds <= MaxDeliberation

\* DeliberationMonotone: deliberationRounds only ever increases.
\* Ensures rounds cannot be rolled back — a key soundness property.
\* @requirement SAFE-03
DeliberationMonotone ==
    [][deliberationRounds' >= deliberationRounds]_vars

\* ── Liveness ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

\* EventualConsensus: every behavior eventually reaches DECIDED.
\* @requirement QUORUM-04
\* @requirement RECV-01
EventualConsensus == <>(phase = "DECIDED")

\* ── Composite actions for fairness ──────────────────────────────────────────
AnyCollectVotes == \E p \in 1..MaxSize : \E n \in 0..p : CollectVotes(n, p)
AnyDeliberate   == \E n \in 0..MaxSize : Deliberate(n)
