# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7-phase structure ordered by dependency depth and blast radius -- cost control first, parallelization last
- [Roadmap]: VERF-01 (file-based state) separated into its own phase as foundation for both memory (Phase 3) and verification (Phase 5)
- [Research]: Zero new npm dependencies -- all patterns build on Node.js built-ins and existing infrastructure

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags Phase 6 (Subagent Orchestration) and Phase 7 (Parallelization) as needing deeper research during planning
- additionalContext token budget contention: multiple injection sources (quorum + memory + verification) must share ~4000 token ceiling
