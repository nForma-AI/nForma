<purpose>
Surface Claude's assumptions about a phase before planning, enabling users to correct misconceptions early.

Key difference from discuss-phase: This is ANALYSIS of what Claude thinks, not INTAKE of what user knows. No file output - purely conversational to prompt discussion.

Assumptions are grounded in formal artifacts (requirements, specs, traceability, test coverage, formal models) before analysis — each assumption is tagged as **grounded** (backed by artifact evidence) or **inferred** (Claude's judgment).

Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (required)

**If argument missing:**

```
Error: Phase number required.

Usage: /nf:list-phase-assumptions [phase-number]
Example: /nf:list-phase-assumptions 3
```

Exit workflow.

**If argument provided:**
Validate phase exists in roadmap:

```bash
cat .planning/ROADMAP.md | grep -i "Phase ${PHASE}"
```

**If phase not found:**

```
Error: Phase ${PHASE} not found in roadmap.

Available phases:
[list phases from roadmap]
```

Exit workflow.

**If phase found:**
Parse phase details from roadmap:

- Phase number
- Phase name
- Phase description/goal
- Any scope details mentioned
- **Requirement IDs** from the `Requirements:` line (e.g., `SHARD-01, ADAPT-01, ADR-01`)

Continue to ground_in_artifacts.
</step>

<step name="ground_in_artifacts">
Read formal artifacts to ground the assumption analysis in evidence. All reads use fail-open: if an artifact is missing or unreadable, note "not found" and continue — never block the workflow.

**0. Handle missing requirement IDs:**
If the phase has no `Requirements:` line in the roadmap (or the line is empty), set the requirement ID list to empty. Log "No requirement IDs found for this phase — grounding will use domain keywords only." All Tier 1-3 reads that depend on requirement IDs are skipped, but domain-keyword-based reads (spec directory scan, test coverage, model registry) still execute. The workflow must never block on a missing Requirements line.

**1. Tier 1 — Requirements text and specs (always read):**

- Read `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` and extract the **exact requirement text** for each phase requirement ID. Present verbatim — do not paraphrase.
- List `.planning/formal/spec/` directory contents. Flag any spec directories that overlap with the phase's domain by matching keywords from the phase name, description, or requirement text against directory names.

**2. Tier 2 — Traceability and test coverage (read if available):**

- Read `.planning/formal/traceability-matrix.json`. For each phase requirement ID, check whether it has traces (code refs, test refs). Note which requirements have traces and which have **gaps** (no traces).
- Read `.planning/formal/unit-test-coverage.json`. Extract test coverage data for files or modules that fall within the phase's domain (match by keyword from phase name/description/requirements).

**3. Tier 3 — Formal requirements envelope and models (reference by ID):**

- Parse `.planning/formal/requirements.json` using **JSON-aware lookup** (e.g., `node -e` with `JSON.parse` or `jq`). Do NOT use literal grep on JSON — it produces partial/malformed matches. For each phase requirement ID, extract: category, status, any linked invariants or background text.
- Read `.planning/formal/model-registry.json`. Check if any Alloy, TLA+, or PRISM models reference the phase's requirement IDs or domain keywords.

**4. Collect grounding data:**
Assemble all results into a grounding summary to flow into analyze_phase:
- Requirement texts (verbatim)
- Matching spec directories
- Traceability status per requirement (traced / gap)
- Test coverage for domain modules
- Formal models touching this domain
- Any artifacts that were "not found"

Continue to analyze_phase.
</step>

<step name="analyze_phase">
Using **both** the grounding data from ground_in_artifacts **and** the roadmap description/project context, identify assumptions across five areas.

Each assumption must be tagged:
- **Grounded** — backed by artifact evidence. Cite the artifact (e.g., "grounded: REQUIREMENTS.md states X", "grounded: traceability-matrix shows no traces for Y").
- **Inferred** — Claude's judgment without direct artifact support. Explain reasoning (e.g., "inferred: based on similar patterns in hooks/config-loader.js").

**1. Technical Approach:**
What libraries, frameworks, patterns, or tools would Claude use?
- "I'd use X library because..." [grounded/inferred]
- "I'd follow Y pattern because..." [grounded/inferred]
- "I'd structure this as Z because..." [grounded/inferred]

**2. Implementation Order:**
What would Claude build first, second, third?
- "I'd start with X because it's foundational" [grounded/inferred]
- "Then Y because it depends on X" [grounded/inferred]
- "Finally Z because..." [grounded/inferred]

**3. Scope Boundaries:**
What's included vs excluded in Claude's interpretation?
- "This phase includes: A, B, C" [grounded/inferred]
- "This phase does NOT include: D, E, F" [grounded/inferred]
- "Boundary ambiguities: G could go either way" [grounded/inferred]

**4. Risk Areas:**
Where does Claude expect complexity or challenges?
- "The tricky part is X because..." [grounded/inferred]
- "Potential issues: Y, Z" [grounded/inferred]
- "I'd watch out for..." [grounded/inferred]

**5. Dependencies:**
What does Claude assume exists or needs to be in place?
- "This assumes X from previous phases" [grounded/inferred]
- "External dependencies: Y, Z" [grounded/inferred]
- "This will be consumed by..." [grounded/inferred]

Be honest about uncertainty. Mark assumptions with confidence levels:
- "Fairly confident: ..." (clear from roadmap or artifacts)
- "Assuming: ..." (reasonable inference)
- "Unclear: ..." (could go multiple ways)
</step>

<step name="present_assumptions">
Present assumptions in a clear, scannable format:

## My Assumptions for Phase ${PHASE}: ${PHASE_NAME}

### Formal Grounding

**Requirements:**
[For each phase requirement ID, show verbatim text from REQUIREMENTS.md]
[If no requirement IDs found: "No requirement IDs specified for this phase — analysis below is inference-only."]

**Existing Specs:**
[List spec/ directories that overlap with this phase's domain, or "None found"]

**Traceability:**
[For each requirement: traced (with refs) or gap (no traces)]
[If no requirement IDs: "N/A — no requirement IDs to trace"]

**Test Coverage:**
[Coverage data for relevant modules, or "No matching modules found"]

**Formal Models:**
[Any Alloy/TLA+/PRISM models touching this domain, or "None found"]

**Artifacts Not Found:**
[List any artifacts that were missing/unreadable, or "All artifacts read successfully"]

- [correction 2]

This changes my understanding significantly. [Summarize new understanding]

What's next?
1. Discuss context (/nf:discuss-phase ${PHASE}) - Let me ask you questions to build comprehensive context
2. Plan this phase (/nf:plan-phase ${PHASE}) - Create detailed execution plans
3. Re-examine assumptions - I'll analyze again with your corrections
4. Done for now
```

Wait for user selection.

If "Discuss context": Note that CONTEXT.md will incorporate any corrections discussed here
If "Plan this phase": Proceed knowing assumptions are understood
