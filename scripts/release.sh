# release.sh — Atomic release: validate, tag, push, and trigger CI/CD pipeline.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/release.sh                              # release current package.json version
#   bash scripts/release.sh --title "Feature Name"       # release with subtitle in title
#   bash scripts/release.sh --dry-run                    # show what would happen without doing it
#   bash scripts/release.sh --dry-run --title "Feature"  # dry run with title
#
# What it does:
#   0. Regenerates assets (terminal SVG + logo SVG/PNG) — catches stale assets before release
#   1. Validates working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes, no stale assets)
#   2. Reads version from package.json
#   3. Validates CHANGELOG.md has an entry for this version
#   4. Validates the git tag doesn't already exist
#   5. Runs test:ci to ensure tests pass
#   6. Creates an annotated git tag vX.Y.Z
#   7. Pushes commit + tag to origin (triggers release.yml → publish.yml)
#
# The GitHub Actions pipeline then:
#   - release.yml: creates GitHub Release from tag
#   - publish.yml: runs tests, builds, publishes to npm with provenance
